## Overview

Users can register, create quests for others, and attempt quests with outcomes based on difficulty and a virtual dice roll. Successful completions grant XP

Full stack project that includes authentication, CRUD functionality, database relationships, and responsive UI design. The app was developed using a PostgreSQL database, an Express backend, and a React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Reflection

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- Editing an existing quest was considered but not implemented.

What was difficult about the tasks you didn't complete?

- Authentication took me a very long time to get fully working
- I have started to add server side validation, but have't fully implemented it for all the routes that would require it. I didn't incorporate it into the frontend all due to time constraints.

- Styling takes me a long time!

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

- Backend: Node.js + Express

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Authentication: Cookie-based session auth
